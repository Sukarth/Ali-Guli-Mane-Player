    ">When you join the game, the game will infom you that it is waiting for the second player to join, beacue this game requires 2 players. After the second player joins, the game will tell you whose turn it is. Player 1 plays on the beige side of the board, while Player 2 plays on the brown side of the board. To play your move, you must choose one of the slots/circles on your side. After you choose your slot, the moves will be calculated and shown quickly. When the game starts, each slot will contain 5 gems. These gems are moved by the game in a anti-clockwise direction until the move ends. There is also a gems counter for each player that shows how many gems each player has recieved after their move has ended. After your move, it is your opponents turn to choose a slot. An important thing to note is that you cannot choose a slot that has no gems in it. The players continue taking turns choosing slots until there are no more gems on the board, when the game ends. The person who has the most gems wins. </h3>
